# Monokai Cola

A Sublime Text color scheme that adds extra definitions to the [Monokai Soda ](http://buymeasoda.github.com/soda-theme/extras/colour-schemes.zip) scheme from the excellent [Buy Me a Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/) theme.

This is basically the original Monokai Soda theme with additional syntax highlighting definitions for Ruby, Markdown, and Slim.

The Slim syntax depends on the the [ruby-slim-tmbundle fork](https://github.com/tycooon/ruby-slim-tmbundle) by Tycoon, as it seems a bit better than the version available through the Sublime Package manager.

## Credits
Many thanks to Ian Hill (http://buymeasoda.com/) for doing all the hard work and creating the original theme!
